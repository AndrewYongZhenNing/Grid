Grid code breaks on GCC4.8, 4.9, 5.0 due to the 
peekIndex<n> operating on lattice.

It erroneously recurses back into the Lattice<obj> variant, even though
the lattice container is dropped.

Work around is possible; if the Lattice routine is given a disambiguating 
name prefix, such as 

latPeekIndex<n> 

GCC5 works. 

However this is ugly and for now I have submitted a bug report to see the reaction and
speed of fixing. 

The simple testcase in this directory is the submitted bug report that encapsulates the
problem. The test case works with icpc and with clang++, but fails consistently on g++
current variants.
